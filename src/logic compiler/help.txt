Evaluator supports the following commands: 
d – Declares a variable with its truth value of either 0 or 1, e.g.:
    d p = 0
    d q = 1
    Leave a space on either side of the equal sign.
e – Evaluates a formula that only contains previously declared variables, e.g.:
    e !(p&q)
    Do NOT leave a space within the formula.

Evaluator supports the following logic operators:
! – Logical NOT
& – Logical AND
| - Logical OR
> – Logical IMPLY
- – Logical XNOR, i.e. double implication

Here's an example of a valid source code file:
d p = 0
d q = 1
d r = 1
e !(p&q)>r
